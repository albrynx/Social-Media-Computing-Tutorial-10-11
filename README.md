# Social-Media-Computing-Tutorial-10-11
## CDS-6334 â€“ Social Media Computing Tutorial 10 & 11

## Objectives
The objectives of this tutorial are:
- Retrieving datasets for evaluating opinion mining.
- Understanding explicit and implicit opinions.
- Implementing transformer models for aspect-level, unsupervised, and supervised machine learning.

## Social Media Opinion Mining
In sentiment analysis and opinion mining, opinions can be classified as:
- **Explicit Opinions:** Directly stated and easily identifiable in the text.
- **Implicit Opinions:** Suggested or implied, requiring inference to understand the sentiment.

### Transformer Model Overview
The transformer model involves:
- Input Sequence
- Embedding
- Selected Topics and Annotation
- Feeddown
- Directed Topics and Unaware Annotations
- Feedback
- Object Sequence
- Aspect Extraction (Rule-Based, Unsupervised, Supervised)

### Levels of Analysis
1. **Aspect Level:** Analyzing sentiment toward specific aspects or features (Week 10).  
   - Exercise: Rule-based algorithms (Dependency parsing, Co-occurrence association rule mining).
2. **Unsupervised Machine Learning:** BiLSTM, Aspect embedding generation, Guided LDA (Week 11).
3. **Supervised Machine Learning:** Hier-GCNN, Fine-tuned BERT (Week 11).
4. **Entity Level:** Analyzing sentiment toward specific entities like brands or people (Week 11).
